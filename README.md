This game was originally made for Portland Indie Game Squad's second Summer Slow Jam of 2018. The original jam version can be found on the "jam" branch.

You can play the jam version at [Itch.io page]("https://drewtooroo.itch.io/the-attic"). It's a web game so it's super easy to play, and lasts 5 - 15 minutes.

Though I had some understanding of most things I worked with here, it was the first time I got my hands dirty with
* The perspective Camera
* Using quads, textures, and materials
* Lighting
* Raycasting against textures

As well, the overall complexity is also a bit more than I've done in a gamejam before. Somehow I got it all working though!

This was also Amy's first game and gamejam ever. This game would not be possible without her great art! She also helped a lot with the gameplay and story.

Thanks for checking this out!
