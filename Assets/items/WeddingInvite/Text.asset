  text: "Dear Nancy,\n\nThis is wonderful news! You're the best person I know, and
    you deserve someone that makes you happy. But I must wonder, how on Earth did
    you meet them? You're a small town girl, and they... well, they're big city folk
    with a healthy bank account. And they're a looker and a kind soul to boot. I'm
    impressed. Do they have siblings? I'm happy for you, and I look forward to the
    wedding!\n\nYours truly, \n\nClaire"
