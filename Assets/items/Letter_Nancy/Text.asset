  text: "Dearest father,\n\nI was so happy to receive word that you accepted my spouse\u2019s
    offer to help stabilize the farm. I know how important the land is to you and
    I hated the idea of you selling it to that nasty bigot, Mr. Standshir! I know
    it was a tough decision for you to accept our help and you said you have every
    intention of paying Emory back, but I wish you could consider it a gift rather
    than a debt. I guess I know who I got my prideful nature from...\n\nLovingly yours,\n\nNancy
    Wentworth"
