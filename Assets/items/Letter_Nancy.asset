  description: An old handwritten letter on faded paper.
  text: "Dearest father,\n\nI was so happy to receive word that you accepted my spouse\u2019s
    offer to help stabilize the farm. I know how important the land is to you and
    I hated the idea of you losing it to that nasty bigot, Mr. Standshir so much!
    I know it was also a tough decision for you to accept our help and I know you
    said you have every intention of paying Emory back, but I wish you could consider
    it a gift rather than a debt. I guess I know who I got my prideful nature from...\n\nLovingly
    yours,\n\nNancy Wentworth"
