  text: "Dear Nancy,\n\nThis is wonderful news! You are kind and beautiful and you
    deserve someone that makes you happy. But I must wonder, how on Earth did you
    meet them? You're a small town girl, and they, well, they're big city folk with
    a healthy bank account\u2026 Do they have siblings? And they're a looker and a
    kind soul to boot. I'm impressed. I look forward to the wedding!\n\nYours truly,
    \n\nClaire\n"
