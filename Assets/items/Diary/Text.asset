  text: "Things seem to have worked out. The Springfield police department has offered
    to settle for a hundred thousand in return for my silence surrounding my wrongful
    arrest. I still don't know where the blood on the combine came from, but I suspect
    it was planted by Mr. Standshir. For my sake I'll let it go: I know they'll bring
    no charges against him. That aside, I\u2019m going to accept their offer. I know
    Nancy and Emory don\u2019t expect me to repay them, but I want them to have that
    money for their honeymoon. Plus a little extra will allow me to visit them up
    in New York and hire a worker, now that Nancy is married. "
