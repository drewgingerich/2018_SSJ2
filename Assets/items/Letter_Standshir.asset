  text: "Mr. Boyer,\n\nIt has come to my attention that you have something of a financial
    problem. Now, I've been working hard and doing well for myself, and I'd like to
    offer you a hand. I will buy your land and home for $25,000. \n\nLet me know soon
    and I\u2019ll have my lawyer take us through the sale.\n\nYour neighbor,\n\nMr.
    Standshir\n"
