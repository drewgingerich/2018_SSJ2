  description: A news clipping. It was cut out roughly and quickly, almost angrily.
  text: Today local police detained Jonathan Boyer, known to most as a reserved man
    operating Boyer Farm past the outskirts of town. He is suspected of killing his
    only daughter, Nancy Boyer. Police were contacted after a message was left by
    a concerned neighbor citing blood on the Boyer farm combine and an out-of-character,
    agitated demeanor presented by Jonathan Boyer. When police confronted him, Jonathan
    Boyer had no explanation for the blood on the combine. Jonathan Boyer is currently
    undergoing questioning at the police station.
