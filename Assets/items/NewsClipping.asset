  description: Test
  text: Today local police detained Jonathan Boyer for the potential murder of his
    only daughter, Nancy Boyer. Police were contacted after a message was left at
    our office by a concerned neighbor that decided to investigate after hearing shocking
    rumors about the disappearance of Nancy Boyer. The neighbor requested not to be
    named, but is known to by an upstanding citizen. This neighbor reported that Jonathan
    Boyer appeared extremely agitated, and also noted a large quantity of dried blood
    on the blades of a Boyer farm combine. Police confirmed both accounts. Jonathan
    Boyer had no explanation for the blood on the combine. Jonathan Boyer has not
    admitted to anything yet, but is currently undergoing questioning at the police
    station. Police have blocked off the Boyer residence as a crime scene and are
    conducting a close inspection.
